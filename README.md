# Autocont_project
This is a homework for Autocont
For this code to work you need to check your java version by `java -version` and add your version to pom.xml on line 35 and 36. I was using version 1.8.
Also you need to have maven installed and you have to add maven in your PATH. You can check if maven is in your path with command mvn `mvn -version`. Then on line 43 in pom.xml you can add your version of maven. I was using version 3.0.0.
After those checks you have to navigate in folder by `cd /homowork-autocont/src/test/java/gmail/google/com/ ` and write `mvn clean test` which will start this test.
In this project Ive used google chrome only so you need to have google chrome installed on version 90.0 so selenium driver will work. I am using version 90.0.4430.85.
